# Basic Calculator with Functions

A Python-based console application that performs basic arithmetic operations using functions. This project demonstrates modular programming by separating operations into dedicated functions.

---

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second (returns a float result).

---

## Usage

1. Enter the first number when prompted.
2. Enter the second number when prompted.
3. Select an operation from the following options:
   - `+` for Addition
   - `-` for Subtraction
   - `*` for Multiplication
   - `/` for Division
4. View the result of the selected operation.

## Example Run

```plaintext
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Select operation.
+ for Addition
- for Subtraction
* for Multiplication
/ for Division
+
Sum is 15
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher.

---

## Notes

- This calculator supports integers for all operations and floats for division.
- The program does not handle exceptions like division by zero. You can enhance it by adding error handling.
